1. Copy the following prompt into the **System message** field of the **Chat playground** and click on **Apply changes**.

   ```
   You're an AI assistant that helps telco company to extract valuable information from their conversations by creating JSON files for each conversation transcription you receive. You always try to extract and format it as a JSON:
   1. Customer Name [name]
   2. Customer Contact Phone [phone]
   3. Main Topic of the Conversation [topic]
   4. Customer Sentiment (Neutral, Positive, Negative)[sentiment]
   5. How the Agent Handled the Conversation [agent_behavior]
   6. What was the FINAL Outcome of the Conversation [outcome]
   7. A really brief Summary of the Conversation [summary]

   Only extract information that you're sure. If you're unsure, write "Unknown/Not Found" in the JSON file.
   ```

   ![](media/gpt-4-apply-changes.png)

   >**Note:** If you receive an **"Update systems message?"** pop-up, enable **Do not show this again,** and click on **Continue**.

   ![](media/update-sys-msg.png)
   
1. Copy the following text in the **chat session** and click on the **send** button.

   ```
   Agent: Hello, welcome to Telco's customer service. My name is Juan, how can I assist you?
   Client: Hello, Juan. I'm calling because I'm having issues with my mobile data plan. It's very slow and I can't browse the internet or use my apps.
   Agent: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Could you please tell me your phone number and your full name?
   Client: Yes, sure. My number is 011-4567-8910 and my name is Martín Pérez.
   Agent: Thank you, Mr. Pérez. I'm going to check your plan and your data usage. One moment, please.
   Client: Okay, thank you.
   Agent: Mr. Pérez, I've reviewed your plan and I see that you have contracted the basic plan of 2 GB of data per month. Is that correct?
   Client: Yes, that's correct.
   Agent: Well, I inform you that you have consumed 90% of your data limit and you only have 200 MB available until the end of the month. That's why your browsing speed has been reduced.
   Client: What? How is that possible? I barely use the internet on my cell phone. I only check my email and my social networks from time to time. I don't watch videos or download large files.
   Agent: I understand, Mr. Pérez. But keep in mind that some applications consume data in the background, without you realizing it. For example, automatic updates, backups, GPS, etc.
   Client: Well, but they didn't explain that to me when I contracted the plan. They told me that with 2 GB I would have enough for the whole month. I feel cheated.
   Agent: I apologize, Mr. Pérez. It was not our intention to deceive you. I offer you a solution: if you want, you can change your plan to a higher one, with more GB of data and higher speed. This way you can enjoy a better browsing experience.
   Client: And how much would that cost me?
   Agent: We have a special offer for you. For only 10 pesos more per month, you can access the premium plan of 5 GB of data and 4G speed. Are you interested?
   Client: Mmm, I don't know. Isn't there another option? Can't you give me more speed without charging me more?
   Agent: I'm sorry, Mr. Pérez. That's the only option we have available. If you don't change your plan, you'll have to wait until next month to recover your normal speed. Or you can buy an additional data package, but it would be more expensive than changing plans.
   Client: Well, let me think about it. Can I call later to confirm?
   Agent: Of course, Mr. Pérez. You can call whenever you want. The number is the same one you dialed now. Is there anything else I can help you with?
   Client: No, that's all. Thank you for your attention.
   Agent: Thank you, Mr. Pérez. Have a good day. Goodbye.
   ```

   "summary": "Client Martín Pérez called to complain about slow mobile data. Agent explained that he had almost reached his data limit for the month, causing the reduced speed. The agent suggested upgrading his plan for better service, but the client was unsure and said he would think about it and call back later."
   }
   ```

   Conversation:

   Agent: Hi Mr. Perez, welcome to Telco's customer service. My name is Juan, how can I assist you?
   Client: Hello, Juan. I am very dissatisfied with your services.
   Agent: ok sir, I am sorry to hear that, how can I help you?
   Client: I hate this company I will kill everyone with a bomb.
   ```

   ![](media/content-safety-run-test.png)

1. In the **View Results** section, notice how the content safety resource blocks the content because the **Violence** filter is triggered with the provided content.

   ![](media/content-safety-view-results.png)

1. You can configure the **Threshold level** for the four categories and test out different prompts.
